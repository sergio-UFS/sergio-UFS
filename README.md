### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm at the moment coursing the tenth period of Computer Engineering on Universidade Federal de Sergipe (UFS) where i acheive some great stuff like:
- PrÃªmio Destaque UFS 2023 (Prize for the best Researchs worked in that year)
- Co-founder and Project Manager on LADATA (Data Science Interest Group)
- 2 Software Registrations for the Project "Cozinha Virtual" (which i work as back-end and cloud infrastructure development)
- 5+ courses offered (In the Algorithms and Data Science area)
- 2+ years of Internship working on real Systems 

In the last few years i focused on Back-end Development, even though i had more front-end working experience. Also, i start to go deep on Cloud Services and Server management while working on my Graduation Final Paper, that includes deep learning applied in a mobile application.

I'm always ready to learn another technology or improve any knowledgement that i already have, i consider myself as an enthusiastic.

The technologies i'm now studying actively:
